            <h2>Basics of a LR2 skin</h2>
            <span>A skin contains three key files: A definition file (.lr2skin), a configuration file (.csv), and
                image/audio files (.png or .jpg for image, .mpg for video).</span> <br>
            <span>The .lr2skin and .csv files are actually plain text files, and thus can be opened and edited in any
                text processing software (or just Notepad)</span>
            <br><br>
            Like this: <br>
            <img src="./lr2skinopen.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

            <br><br>
            <span>As for the external image/video or .csv file reference:
                <br><span class="def">#IMAGE</span> for images/videos
                <br><span class="def">#INCLUDE</span> for .csv files
                <br><span class="def">#LR2FONT</span> for bitmap font files (we will get to that later in this guide)
            </span>
        </div>
        <div class="section1">
            <h2 class="title">.lr2skin file</h2>
            <span>The heart of an LR2 skin.</span>
            <br>
            <span>This file is checked and loaded on startup, so if any changes are made to the file while LR2 is
                running, the changes won't be registered.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>The skin contains vital information about the skin such as its name and creator, where it is used and
                its references.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>It is also technically a CSV file at heart, and can also be edited in spreadsheet processors.</span>
            <br>
            <span>Usually Excel is the most convenient application for CSV editing since it automatically converts the
                comma-delimited syntax to tab-delimited on launch.</span><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">If it doesn't, go into locale settings and check if digit grouping symbol
                is a comma.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>The original site covers some of alternatives to Excel, but other than LibreOffice Calc, I'm not sure
                if the rest of the ones mentioned are still up and downloadable.</span>
            <br>
            <span>Here is a list of some modern-day alternatives:</span>
            <ul>
                <li class="def">LibreOffice Calc</li>
                <li class="def">Google Sheets</li>
                <li class="def">WPS Office Sheets</li>
                <li class="def">VSCode with Rainbow CSV (not required, but helps a lot)</li>
            </ul>
            <span>...or just use Notepad</span>
        </div>
        <div class="section2">
            <h2 class="title">
                .csv file
            </h2>
            <span>The .csv file is a configuration file that contains the skin's settings and references to the
                definitions used in the skin.</span>
            <br>
            <span>It is used to define the layout and behavior of the skin, such as the position and size of elements,
                as well as their visibility and functionality.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>While it is used in almost every skin, it is <span class="imp">NOT</span> mandatory.</span>
            <br>
            <span>If you're a maniac you can just implement all the definitions in one .lr2skin file if you want</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>The convenience of using .csv files is that you can change the definitions in it on-the-fly, without
                the need to restart LR2.</span>
            <br>
            <span>It is also useful for option branching (one file is used for one definition and others for other
                definitions).</span>
        </div>
        <div class="section3">
            <h2 class="title">
                Image files
            </h2>
            <span>Image files are used to display graphics in the skin, such as backgrounds, buttons, and other visual
                elements.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>LR2/LVF supports most common image formats such as .bmp, .png or .jpg, and less commonly known ones
                such as .tga or .dds (while less tools support these filetypes, but I guess it's better than .png
                in-game???)</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>For editing these files, anything that has support for alpha channels is <span
                    class="imp">HIGHLY</span> recommended.</span>
            <br>
            <span>For example, <span class="def">GIMP, Photoshop, Paint.NET</span>, or even online editors like <span
                    class="def">Photopea.</span></span>
            <br>
            <span>In my experience, using Paint.NET is recommended because of it's versatility and simplicity compared
                to other editing softwares if you're just creating simple sprites.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="section4">
            <h2 class="title">
                Video files
            </h2>
            <span>As far as I know, the applications of a video file is not a lot, except for the BGA and the select
                skin background.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>LR2/LVF supports .mpg files, and it is recommended to use a video editor that can export to this
                format.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Keep in mind that you cannot set the starting coordinates, nor the partial width and height of the
                file, nor its transparency.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="section5">
            <h2 class="title">
                .lr2font files
            </h2>
            <span>LR2/LVF supports bitmap fonts, which are used to display text in the skin.</span>
            <br>
            <span>Each font spritesheet has one .lr2font file, which points where the characters should be as well as
                it's width, height, and spacing.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>I recommend using <a href="https://mistyblue.info/tools.html#mafu">MAFU</a> (as a replacement for
                hard-to-use built-in FontUtil). <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If anyone can find the
                    download link to it please @ me.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Thanks @moodreceptor on
                    Discord for the link!</span></span>

                <h2 class="title">DXA encoding</h2>
                <span>It is possible to use DXA encoding to compress files and save storage.
                    <br>
                    <span>As far as I know, there isn't a more convenient tool to encode/decode such files, other than
                        its built-in tools. (DxaEncode / DxaDecode)</span>
                    <br>
                    <span>To encode/decode a file, use the command line tool with the following syntax since help doesnt
                        work:</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="def">DxaEncode.exe [input font folder] [output dxa file]
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        DxaDecode.exe [input dxa file path] [output folder]
