              For example, if you have a sprite that is divided into 4

              intepret as 4 frames of an animation (T -> E -> S -> T).

              This is usually used in transitions/animations, which requires
              multiple lines of DST in the same sprite definition. Some examples
              will be shown later.

              Usually it is kept within the 640x480 canvas (LR2 Vanilla) or
              1280x720 (LR2 HD Patch) or 1920x1080 (LR2 FHD Patch).
              <br />
              But you can technically set it to any coordinates, even outside
              the canvas (or even negative coordinates), but it will not be
              visible in-game. This is useful for off-screen animations,
              commonly used in most skins. <br /><br />
              As for the width and height, it is usually set to the same as the
              SRC definition for 1:1 rendering, but it can be set to any size,
              even larger than the SRC definition.
              <br />
              It is also possible to set the w and h values to negative values,
              which will change the anchor point of the sprite to the
              bottom-right corner instead of the top-left corner.

        <h2>Display priority</h2>
        <span>
          The display priority of the DST definitions is determined by the order
          in which they are defined in the .csv file. The later a DST is defined
          in the .csv fine, the higher its display priority is.
          <br />

          There are other definitions that follow the same pattern as #SRC_IMAGE

          many as you want.
          <br />
          Do note that the DST of these definitions are ommited as it is the

              If the div_y value is 24, it will display a plus/minus sign

              Depending on the value of <span class="def">align</span>, the

                <li>2: Literally the middle</li>
              </ul>
              Do note that in Lunatic Vibes, the anchor point is always set to
              the least significant digit, regardless of the alignment value.
              <br /><br />
              <span class="imp">Note:</span> The keta value does not count the
              plus/minus sign, so you must add 1 to to the keta value to display
