        <span>Basically speaking, rendering sprites in LR2 follow 3 simple
          steps:</span>
        <ol class="steps">
          <li>Starting from a #IMAGE file,</li>
          <li>Cut out a portion(or whole) from the #SRC_XX definition,</li>
          <li>
            Render the cut-out portion to the screen from the #DST_XX
            definition.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <span>
          <strong>MAKE SURE THAT</strong> the XX in #SRC_XX and #DST_XX match
          each other!</span>
        <br />
        <span>Else the game will <strong>NOT</strong> render the sprite in-game
          at all!</span>
        <br />
        <h6>Trust me, I have been there.</h6>
        <span>The game picks up the definitions from #SRC_XX and #DST_XX, and
          ignores everything with a different starting syntax.</span>
        <br />
        <span>Even though you can technically just create a comment line using no
          prefix syntax at all, it's better to start those lines with
          <strong>// (two slashes)</strong></span>
      </div>
      <br /><br />
      <span>#SRC_IMAGE and #DST_IMAGE is the most commonly used definition and is
        also the base for the DST definitions of almost all others, so it's
        safe to use the arguments tfor other definition types.</span>
      <br /><br />
      <div class="image">
        <a name="image" class="title nodec">#IMAGE</a>
        <br /><br />
        <span>The #IMAGE definition is used to reference an image file in the
          skin.</span>
        <br />
        <span>Up to 100 can be defined for one single .csv file (?)</span>
        <br />
        <span>Starting from the topmost-defined one, the
          <strong>gr</strong> value is assigned starting from 0
          automatically.</span>
        <span>It's common practice to comment the gr number of a file on the same
          line as the #IMAGE definition, for easy reference later.</span>
        <br /><br />
        <span>Generally, it should look something like this:</span><br />
        <img src="./img/def.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: auto" />
        <br /><br />
        Which correspond to these files in the skin folder:
        <br />
        <img src="./img/sprites.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: auto" />
        <br /><br />
        <div class="context">
          <span>Example</span>
          <br />
          <span>For example, the gr value used for
            <span class="def">number.png</span> is 1:</span>
          <br />
          <img src="./img/demo1.png" alt="" style="width: 25%; height: auto" />
          <br /><br />
          <span>And the <span class="def">button.png</span> file, which is
            defined fifth, has the gr value of 4:</span>
          <br />
          <img src="./img/demo2.png" alt="" style="width: 25%; height: auto" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <a class="title nodec" name="src_image">#SRC_IMAGE</a><br /><br />
      <span>We will use image.png as an example.</span> <br />
      <img src="./img/demo3.png" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: auto" />
      <br /><br />
      <span>The explaination for each setting is as follows:</span>

            <br />Depending on the software you're using, when the sprite you

            and size. <br />

            sprite. <br />
            It is used for animations, NUMBER or BUTTON definitions, among
            other special ones. <br />
            <br />
            For example, if you have a sprite that is divided into 4
            horizontal sections, you would set div_x to 4, and the game will
            intepret as 4 frames of an animation (T -> E -> S -> T).

            defined is reached, the animation is completed and starts again at
            the first frame. <br /><br />
            The time for each frame is <span class="def">cycle</span> divided
            by

            Specify the time in miliseconds when the DST condition is met.
            <br />
            This is usually used in transitions/animations, which requires
            multiple lines of DST in the same sprite definition. Some examples
            will be shown later.

            The pasting destination in the LR2 window. <br /><br />
            Usually it is kept within the 640x480 canvas (LR2 Vanilla) or
            1280x720 (LR2 HD Patch) or 1920x1080 (LR2 FHD Patch).
            <br />
            But you can technically set it to any coordinates, even outside
            the canvas (or even negative coordinates), but it will not be
            visible in-game. This is useful for off-screen animations,
            commonly used in most skins. <br /><br />
            As for the width and height, it is usually set to the same as the
            SRC definition for 1:1 rendering, but it can be set to any size,
            even larger than the SRC definition.
            <br />
            It is also possible to set the w and h values to negative values,
            which will change the anchor point of the sprite to the
            bottom-right corner instead of the top-left corner.

            sprite.
            <br />
            Do note that if the selected sprite is black, the rgb value will
            not change the color of the sprite, as it is already black.

            Please note that the blending modes are not the same as in editing
            software, and may not work as expected. To be honest, I don't know
            what some of these blending modes do, and I haven't seen them used
            in skins except for the alpha channel blending.

      <h2>Display priority</h2>
      <span>
        The display priority of the DST definitions is determined by the order
        in which they are defined in the .csv file. The later a DST is defined
        in the .csv fine, the higher its display priority is.
        <br />
        Take a look at the example below:
      </span>
      <br />
      <img src="./img/overlayingdst.png" alt="" style="width: 25%; height: auto" /><br />
      <span>Here, the example above is achieved with DST_B defined after
        DST_A.</span>

      <a name="gendef" class="title nodec">Other generic definitions</a>

        There are other definitions that follow the same pattern as #SRC_IMAGE
        and #DST_IMAGE, but are used for different purposes. You can use as
        many as you want.
        <br />
        Do note that the DST of these definitions are ommited as it is the
        same as the #DST_IMAGE definition.

            Depending on the value of <span class="def">align</span>, the

            Do note that in Lunatic Vibes, the anchor point is always set to
            the least significant digit, regardless of the alignment value.
            <br /><br />
            <span class="imp">Note:</span> The keta value does not count the
            plus/minus sign, so you must add 1 to to the keta value to display
